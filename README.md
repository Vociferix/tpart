This is a fun little experiment that implements a 2D particle simulation in the terminal.

A source of gravity can be created by clicking on the terminal. The mouse can also be
dragged while clicking to move the gravity source around. 'q' ends the simulation.
Backspace resets the simulation.

Your terminal must support mouse events and RGB ANSI codes.
